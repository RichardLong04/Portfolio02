        <h3>Monkaa</h3>
        <p>This was first project at Seattle University. The objective was to use HTML/CSS to embed media in a simple one page site. This was my first attempt at creating a responsive website. Making this project responsive wasn’t a requirement, but I decided that it would be a good thing to start learning as soon as possible. I found that there were a few hurdles to jump over, but I researched and solved each problem as they arose.</p>

        <h3>API</h3>
        <p>API was my first experience with bootstrap, and it was also a final project for a class at Seattle University. I didn't like using the Bootstrap templates, so I decided to use  blank template and teach myself how to create my own design using  HTML/CSS. Creating my own design was a bit challenging at first, but I worked through the barriers and created a bright, colorful, playful project and had a good time doing it.</p>

        <h3>ISUD</h3>
        <p>Here is my first group project at Illinois Tech. We gave really bad site a makeover, using HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript. Git Hub was used to merge each team members files to create one cohesive project, as we were all working remotely. There were many challenges with this site, but the biggest one was by far was learning to work with others and compromise on who did what and what it should look like. It’s a bit cliché but good communication is definitely a key to success.</p>

        <p>About me, was my first project using HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript, and it was my first project at Illinois Tech. All the requirements for the project were met, and I received an A, but it's still a work in progress with many improvements to made some time in the near future. This was first time trying to create a responsive nav bar that would work on mobile. I really don't like how it came out and have since figured out a better way to do it.</p>

        <h3>ART of SPITE</h3>
        <p>Art of Spite is an art project that I use a virtual gallery for my media projects. I did use a blank Bootstrap template for this project. I like how well the media queries work with the Bootstrap  frame work. Creating a slide show was challenging, but a really cool learning process. I am really happy with this rendition of Art of Spite.</p>

        <h3>Technical Marketing Inc.</h3>
        <p>TMI was my first freelance project. My client wanted their old outdated website to be given a modern make over. I had to incorporate the existing content into the a new layout that was responsive for mobile devices. There were many challenges along the way; learning to use CSS grids that were responsive was confusing at first. However, after I decided to use a blank bootstrap template and create my own layout, everything scaled down nicely and the customer was pleased.</p>

        <h3>The Computer Café</h3>
        <p>This was project for a company in Pittsburg, PA. Their old site was outdated and needed to be revamped. The budget for this project was very limited.  I had to work fast and deliver  a  functional  product that looked good and met my client's needs. I enjoyed this project and solving the problems that popped up. It was a good communication. And learning experience.</p>
